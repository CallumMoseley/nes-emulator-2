# NES Emulator 2
It's 2 because nes-emulator is deprecated now.

This is a project I've been working on for years now, this rewrite was started in summer 2018, and is being done in C++ using SDL2 for graphics/input.

Unlike previous attempts, I actually have got this emulator to a mostly working state, which is really cool.

### Major TODOs
- Audio
- A large number of mappers (only supports 000 and 001)
- Graphics bug-fixing
- Proper user interface
